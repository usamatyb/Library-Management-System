Library Management System - SQL, PHP

ðŸ“šLibrary Management System aimed at enhancing library operations! This comprehensive system, developed using SQL Database, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, accomplishes several key objectives:

- Authentication System: Seamlessly manage logins for students and admins.
- User Management: Register students and allow for password changes.
- Book Management: Keep track of all available books, their categories, and authors.
- Transaction Tracking: Record books borrowed by users, including issue dates and fines for late returns.
- User Interface Enhancements: Provide a user-friendly experience with features like a student login page and a search function for book availability.

The background of the project highlights the need for computerized library systems to prevent file loss, damage, and difficulty in record retrieval. The system's analysis identifies both functional and non-functional requirements, ensuring efficiency, reliability, and usability for users and librarians alike.

Key functional requirements include user authentication, user and book registration, book search functionality, and book issuing and returning processes.

The software and hardware requirements are outlined, detailing the tools used for both the front end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP) and the back end (MySQL).

The comparison between the existing and proposed systems emphasizes the advantages of the digital system, including error reduction, time and cost savings, and improved resource management.

Overall, this project represents a significant step forward in modernizing library management processes, offering a robust solution for libraries of all sizes.
